### NOTE: Need to floor the proprtions ###

# Summary: Splits the original dataframe df into three sets: the training, test, and candidate sets.
# Input:
#   df: The original dataframe.
#   TestProportion: Proportion of the data that is reserved for testing.
#   CandidateProportion: Proportion of the data that is initially "unseen" and later added to the training set.
# Output:
#   df_Train: The initial training set.
#   df_Test: The test set that is reserved for testing.
#   df_Candidate: The candidate set that is initially "unseen" and later added to the training set.

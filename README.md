## Abstract
[NeurIPS Paper/Presentation](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/98966)

Active learningâ€™s key task is selecting informative data points to enhance model predictions with a fixed labeling budget. However, when ensemble models such as random forests are used, there is a risk of the ensemble containing models with poor predictive accuracy or redundant trees with the same interpretation. To address this, we develop a novel approach to only ensemble the set of near-optimal models called the Rashomon set in order to guide the active learning process. We demonstrate how taking a Rashomon approach can not only improve the accuracy and rate of convergence of the active learning procedure, but also lead to improved interpretability compared to traditional approaches.
